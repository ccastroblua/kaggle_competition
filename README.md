# Diamonds price kaggle competition:

The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts the price of diamonds with a kaggle dataset. This competition is meassured by MSE (Mean Squared Error).


This project has three stages defined:
1. Clean and manipulation of kaggle diamonds dataset.
2. Test of different prediction models. 
3. Fine tunning of model's hyperparameters.


## Files structure:

- Jupyter notebook file (Diamonds-competition.ipynb): File with each stage of the competition.
- "datos" folder with:
    - CSV file (train.csv): CSV file used to train the model
    - CSV file (test.csv): CSV file used to test the model predictions.
    - Several CSV files with different submissions during the competition.
- "apuntes" folder with:
    - Jupyter notebook file (example_train_predict_submit.ipynb): File with a sample way of submitting a prediction.
- "images" folder with:
    - JPG image (dr-strange.jpg): Cover image.

## Libraries used:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Sickit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
